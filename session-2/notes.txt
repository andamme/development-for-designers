Happy new year! :) -Riikka

Happy new year to you Riikka!

When learning new things, I have found it helpful to visualize things â€“ like drawing how I understand or what is the mental model I have in my head about these new skills/tools/ideas/knowledge. 

So probably I should start drawing and add some pics also here as a notes.
