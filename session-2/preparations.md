Tomorrow we'll get our hands dirty with Git and Web Development and whatnot. There are some things for you to install on your own machine and you can install them before the session if you have a while:

- Git: Open Terminal and type "git". Follow instructions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which will be needed for running things on your own machine
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a good code editor for most web development tasks

Also,

- Create a Github account and report your Github username on the Slack channel in this thread
  - You'll get access to our repositories
- Configure your git to always use rebasing when pulling by running this: `git config pull.rebase true`

You can also already clone our repository https://github.com/reaktor/development-for-designers as below

- Open terminal
- `cd` into your "projects directory", or `mkdir` a directory named "reaktor" or similar and then `cd` into it
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:reaktor/development-for-designers.git`
- Go to the directory: `cd development-for-designers` and you're good to go with all the rest of the Git commands
