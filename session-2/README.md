We'll get our hands dirty with Git and Web Development and whatnot.

## Goals

- Learn the basics of Git version control system and Github service
- Get the necessary tools on your own machine, a Github account and some hands-on experience
- Get your first Pull Request approved and merged!

## Preparations

There are some things for you to install on your own machine and you can install them before the session if you have a while:

- Git: Open Terminal and type "git". Follow instructions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which will be needed for running things on your own machine
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is a good code editor for most web development tasks

Also,

- Create a Github account and report your Github username on the Slack channel in this thread
  - You'll get access to our repositories
- Configure your git to always use rebasing when pulling by running this: `git config --global pull.rebase true`

You can also already clone our repository https://github.com/reaktor/development-for-designers as below

- Open terminal
- `cd` into your "projects directory", or `mkdir` a directory named "reaktor" or similar and then `cd` into it
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:reaktor/development-for-designers.git`
- Go to the directory: `cd development-for-designers` and you're good to go with all the rest of the Git commands
